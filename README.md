# Bank Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to explore and analyze the factors influencing customer churn at an Anonymous Multinational Bank. The dataset contains information about the bank's customers, including their demographic details, account information, and customer satisfaction data. By identifying the factors contributing to churn, this analysis will help the bank improve its customer retention strategies.

### Problem Statement

Customer churn is a critical issue for banks as it directly affects their revenue and business growth. The objective of this project is to:

- Explore correlations between customer characteristics such as credit score, age, tenure, balance, and geography with churn.
- Assess the impact of demographic factors like gender and credit card ownership on churn rates.
- Analyze customer satisfaction scores and complaint resolutions to identify areas for service improvement.

### Data

The dataset includes the following variables:

- **Credit Score**: The credit score of the customer.
- **Age**: Age of the customer.
- **Tenure**: Duration of the customerâ€™s relationship with the bank.
- **Balance**: The bank balance of the customer.
- **Geography**: Geographic location of the customer.
- **Gender**: The gender of the customer.
- **Credit Card**: Whether the customer has a credit card with the bank (Yes/No).
- **Satisfaction Score**: Customer satisfaction score based on surveys.
- **Complaint Resolution**: Whether the customer's complaint was resolved (Yes/No).
- **Churn**: Whether the customer left the bank (Yes/No).

### Objective

The primary goal is to identify the key factors driving customer churn. This will enable the bank to implement targeted retention strategies, reduce churn rates, and improve customer satisfaction.

### Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values, and convert categorical features into numerical formats (e.g., encoding).
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize the distribution of key features and explore relationships between them.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or modify existing features to better capture the patterns in customer behavior.
4. **Modeling**: Build and evaluate machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) to predict customer churn.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, ROC AUC to evaluate model performance.
6. **Insights and Recommendations**: Analyze the findings and provide actionable insights to improve customer retention.
